# Lesson 0: Introduction to Web Dev

Web development is the field of creating content for the web.

There are two main components of web development:

## Front-end development

Front-end development involves creating the visual component of the website, the part the user interacts with. This is known
as the **client**.

This involves HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Front-end developers must write code for browsers to interpret and display, so there
is less flexibility in how you can arrange your code as it must be in a format that browsers can understand.

More advanced software developers utilise tools known as **frameworks** which simplify
and speed up the creation of user interfaces. Examples include React, Vue.js and Angular.

In this module, we will stick to using vanilla, unmodified HTML, CSS and JS.

## Back-end development

Back-end development involves creating the functional component of the website, the software systems that run in the background that enable it to provide a service. This is known as the **server**, as the code usually runs on a remote server in the cloud.

Back-end software systems are usually made with Python, JavaScript, Java, C# and more. There is much more variety in how you
can create a back-end system as the implementation can be entirely decided by you.

Server-side code is typically the main difficulty of making a website, as it determines the actual functionality it has.
The client or front-end is simply there to display information and allow the user to input actions.

## [Activity] Create a development environment

In order to practice HTML, CSS and JS we will make an online code sandbox.

1. Go to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/).
2. Sign up with your school account or GitHub
3. Create a vanilla HTML + CSS sandbox
